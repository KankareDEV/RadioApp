## Flutter Radio Project
I'm excited to share my Flutter RadioApp with you! It was quite a journey to create this app, taking me nearly 9 hours of hard work. The biggest challenge was finding a reliable Radio Station API, but after some extensive searching, I stumbled upon a fantastic audio API on the internet that saved the day.

During the development process, I had a blast adding a cool animation feature that showcases animated cards when you launch the app and move the cards. I wanted to keep the app's design clean and uncluttered, so I focused on simplicity to ensure a seamless user experience.

Looking back, I can't help but think about the features I'd love to add if I had more time. One idea that comes to mind is incorporating a "Favorites" button. It would make it easier for users to quickly access their most beloved stations or cherished music from the list.

Overall, I'm really proud of how this app turned out, and I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it! ðŸ˜„
